Calculus II for the life and social sciences<!--more-->

*Catalog description*: Math 136 is the second semester of the Math 135-136 sequence for students studying Life Sciences or Social Sciences. Math 136 is designed specifically for students who want a second semester of calculus for their technical background, but who do not intend to take further courses in Calculus or Differential Equations. Therefore, Math 136 offers a mixture of traditional Calculus II topics and of additional topics—such as mulitivariate functions and constrained optimization using Lagrange multipliers—that students are likely to meet in scientific applications.

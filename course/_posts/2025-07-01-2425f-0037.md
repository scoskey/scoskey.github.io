Mathematical logic<!--more-->

*Catalog description*: This module is an introduction to propositional and first order logic. We study the interplay between semantic (truth, meaning) and syntactic (deductive) aspects of logic. The module has an emphasis on applications of ideas from logic in other areas of mathematics, mainly graph theory, combinatorics, and algebra.

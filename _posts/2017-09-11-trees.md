*Abstract*: We identify the complexity of the classification problem for automorphisms of a given countable regularly branching tree up to conjugacy. We consider both the rooted and unrooted cases. Additionally, we calculate the complexity of the conjugacy problem in the case of automorphisms of several non-regularly branching trees.

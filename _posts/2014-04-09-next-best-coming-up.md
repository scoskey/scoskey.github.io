The BEST conference (Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory) will be held this Summer at UC Riverside on June 18--20. ([conference site](http://math.boisestate.edu/~best/))<!--more-->

The meeting is held in conjunction with the annual meeting of Pacific Division of the AAAS, so there will be many talks of general scientific interest going on as well. Our speakers will include Joel Hamkins, Dima Sinapova, Nam Trang, and Andrew Marks.

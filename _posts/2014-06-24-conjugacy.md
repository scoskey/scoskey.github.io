With Paul Ellis. Accepted to *Mathematical logic quarterly*, 2016. ([ar&chi;iv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6411))<!--more-->

*Abstract*: We consider the conjugacy problem for the automorphism groups of a number of countable homogeneous structures. In each case we find the precise complexity of the conjugacy relation in the sense of Borel reducibility.

*Further notes*: This article continues the work of [this one](/summer).

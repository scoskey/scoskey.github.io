Boise Set Theory Seminar, April 2016<!--more--><

*Abstract*: We present a now classical theorem of López-Escobar which connects descriptive set theory and countable model theory. We then briefly introduce the theory of metric structures, and give a generalization of the theorem to this context. This is joint work with Martino Lupini.

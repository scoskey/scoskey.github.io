The Boise Math Teachers' Circle held its first annual workshop in the last three days of July. The Circle joins together talented and interested local teachers with BSU faculty to participate in an environment of mathematical discovery.

Here is the [workshop page](http://boisemathcircles.org/summer-workshop-2015/)!<!--more-->

I participated in numerous enjoyable sessions, as well as helped run three of them:

* Polygons on a sphere - measuring the angles and areas of triangles on the surface of a sphere
* Iteration - repeatedly applying a linear function to a given number and deciding when the resulting sequence converges
* Dimensions - Looking at some remarkable sets with fractional or fractal "dimensions"

*Catalog description*: Structured as three five-week components: formal logic, set theory, and topics to be determined by the instructor. The logic component includes formalization of language and proofs, the completeness theorem, and the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem. The set theory component includes orderings, ordinals, the transfinite recursion theorem, and the Axiom of Choice and some of its equivalents.

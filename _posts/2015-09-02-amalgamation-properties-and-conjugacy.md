Boise Set Theory Seminar, Wednesday September 2, 2015<!--more-->

*Abstract*: In this talk we aim to classify automorphisms of ultrahomogeneous structures up to conjugacy. (Ultrahomogeneous structures are highly self-symmetric and can be viewed as a kind of generic limit of their finite pieces.) In past talks I gave several examples of homogeneous structures and settled the classification problem for their automorphisms. After reviewing the classical combinatorial framework, we will generalize the methods that worked for specific examples to broader classes of ultrahomogeneous structures.

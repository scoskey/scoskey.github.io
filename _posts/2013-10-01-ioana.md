*ISRN algebra*, 2013. ([ar&chi;iv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2359) \| [journal](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/387540))<!--more-->

*Abstract*: In this expository article, we give a survey of Adrian Ioana's cocycle superrigidity theorem for profinite actions of Property (T) groups, and its applications to ergodic theory and set theory.  In addition to a statement and proof of Ioana's theorem, this article features:

* An introduction to rigidity, including a crash course in Borel cocycles and a summary of some of the best-known superrigidity theorems;
* Some easy applications of superrigidity, both to ergodic theory (orbit equivalence) and set theory (Borel reducibility); and
* A streamlined proof of Simon Thomas's theorem that the classification of torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank is intractable.

*Further notes*: This article provides a complement to my dissertation.  It helps explain some of the context and motivation, and it reproduces a proof of one of the central black boxes that I used.

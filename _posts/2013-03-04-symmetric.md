History's first whiff of Galois theory.  With Ben Blum-Smith. Accepted to *College mathematics journal*, 2016. ([ar&chi;iv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7116))<!--more-->

*Article summary*: This expository and pedagogical article was initiated by Ben Blum-Smith, and is based on some discussions that came out of an abstract algebra class he gave for teachers in New York.

The fundamental theorem on symmetric polynomials states that if a polynomial in $n$ variables is *symmetric* (meaning it is invariant under permutations of the variables), then it can be expressed in terms of the *elementary symmetric polynomials*:
\[\begin{array}{c}x_1+\cdots+x_n\\
x_1x_2+\cdots+x_{n-1}x_n\\
\vdots\\
x_1\cdots x_n\end{array}
\]
This elementary result played a key role in Galois' work.  The standard proof is an inductive one, and is based on a monomial order such as the lexicographic ordering on the terms of the given polynomial $f$.

This argument, while standard among the experienced, is not easy to arrive at from a naive perspective.  In this article we present another proof which arose out of our inquiry-based discussions in which the terms of $f$ are dealt with based on a natural notion of how "spread out" their exponents are.

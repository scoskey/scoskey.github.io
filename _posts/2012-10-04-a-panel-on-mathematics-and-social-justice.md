Thanks to Project NExT, I have the opportunity to participate in organizing a panel session at the next JMM.  The exact date and time are TBA.  The topic will be Mathematics and Social Justice.  If you have any suggestions about this topic---favorite links, articles, or teachers---please leave a comment!<!--more-->

The idea came from an excellent talk by Professor [David Kung](http://faculty.smcm.edu/dtkung).  He presented the topic in two separate components:

* There are opportunities to improve justice within mathematics education itself.  For instance, there are large performance and retention gaps depending on gender, ethnicity, and so on.
* Social justice causes make good topics for a (possibly terminal) math class.  For instance, elementary statistics are used in environmental science and every other social science.  Math is also important in understanding politics and making voting choices.

We hope to organize our panel to focus on both of these components.

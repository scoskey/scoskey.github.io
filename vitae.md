# More about me

I am originally from Seattle. I'm into math and discussing math, from the elementary to the research level. Aside from math, I have been known to juggle, play tennis and aerobie, read novels, and listen to music. I am an advocate of cycling as a means of transportation. Having studied computer science in the past, I enjoy thinking about how modern web tools can help us share and work together on math.

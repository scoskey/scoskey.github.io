# More about me

I am originally from Seattle. I'm into math and discussing math, from the elementary to the research level. Aside from math, I have been known to juggle, play tennis and aerobie, read novels, and listen to music. I am an advocate of cycling as a means of transportation. I used to study computer science, and now I enjoy thinking about ways mathematicians can use modern web tools to share and work together.

*Abstract*: Notes based on a graduate course in set theory. The first part covers measure, category, the continuum hypothesis, and cardinal characteristics of the continuum. The second part introduces the method forcing, and concludes by showing how forcing can prove independence results about the continuum hypothesis as well as the values of the cardinal characteristics.

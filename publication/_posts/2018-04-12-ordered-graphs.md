*Abstract*: We show that for any countable homogeneous ordered graph $G$, the conjugacy problem for automorphisms of $G$ is Borel complete. In fact we establish that each such $G$ satisfies a strong extension property called ABAP, which implies that the isomorphism relation on substructures of $G$ is Borel reducible to the conjugacy relation on automorphisms of $G$.

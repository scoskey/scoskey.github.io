*Abstract*: We introduce the computable FS-jump, an analog of the classical Friedman--Stanley jump in the context of equivalence relations on $\mathbb N$. We prove that the computable FS-jump is proper with respect to computable reducibility. We then study the effect of the computable FS-jump on computably enumerable equivalence relations (ceers).

*Abstract*: Boykin and Jackson recently introduced a property of countable Borel equivalence relations called Borel boundedness, which they showed is closely related to the union problem for hyperfinite equivalence relations. In this paper, we introduce a family of properties of countable Borel equivalence relations which correspond to combinatorial cardinal characteristics of the continuum in the same way that Borel boundedness corresponds to the bounding number $\mathfrak b$.  We analyze some of the basic behavior of these properties, showing for instance that the property corresponding to the splitting number $\mathfrak s$ coincides with smoothness.  We then settle many of the implication relationships between the properties; these relationships turn out to be closely related to (but not the same as) the Borel Tukey ordering on cardinal characteristics.

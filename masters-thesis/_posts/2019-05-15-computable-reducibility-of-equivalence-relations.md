*Abstract*: Computable reducibility of equivalence relations is a tool to compare the complexity of equivalence relations on natural numbers. Its use is important to those doing Borel equivalence relation theory, computability theory, and computable structure theory. In this thesis, we compare many naturally occurring equivalence relations with respect to computable reducibility. We will then define a jump operator on equivalence relations and study proprieties of this operation and its iteration. We will then apply this new jump operation by studying its effect on the isomorphism relations of well-founded computable trees.

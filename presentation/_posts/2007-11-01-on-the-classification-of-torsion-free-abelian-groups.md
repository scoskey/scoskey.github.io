CUNY Logic Workshop, New York, November 2007<!--more-->

*Abstract*: Hjorth and Thomas have used the theory of countable Borel equivalence relations to show that the classification problem for the torsion-free abelian groups of rank $n$ strictly increases in complexity with the rank $n$. In the first half of the talk, I will present a brief introduction to the theory of countable Borel equivalence relations, including the notion of a *Borel reduction* which provides a complexity comparison for Borel equivalence relations. Then I will show how to identify the classification problem for torsion-free abelian groups of fixed finite rank $n$ with a suitable Borel equivalence relation on a standard Borel space.

In the second half of the talk, I will study the quasi-isomorphism relation on the space of torsion-free abelian groups of rank $n$. Here, $A$ and $B$ are said to be *quasi-isomorphic* iff A is commensurable with an isomorphic copy of B. Although Thomas has shown that the complexity of the quasi-isomorphism relation also strictly increases with the rank n, there are a number of ways in which quasi-isomorphism is "nicer" than isomorphism, and it is natural to conjecture that the isomorphism relation is simpler than the quasi-isomorphism relation. Neverthless, I will outline a proof that the isomorphism and quasi-isomorphism equivalence relations are actually incomparable with respect to Borel reducibility.

Boise Mathematics Teaching Talks, Boise, January 2015<!--more-->

*Abstract*: In this talk I'll summarize my efforts to involve students in projects that replicate the math research experience. In particular I will discuss a set of projects and corresponding curriculum (adapted from another university) for Math 287. The projects require students to ask questions, formulate conjectures, investigate them in groups, and express their findings in writing. Investigations of this type are appropriate for students at the 200-400 level, and can easily become material for a senior thesis.

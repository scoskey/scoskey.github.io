Boise Set Theory Seminar, March 2018<!--more-->

*Abstract*: A linear order is called scattered if the rational order doesn't embed into it. Scattered linear orders admit a derivative operation and an ordinal rank. In this talk we introduce some machinery needed to study the complexity of the classification of scattered linear orders of a given countable rank.

Boise Set Theory Seminar, Boise, December 2012<!--more-->

*Abstract*: Operator algebras is an area of analysis where set theory has had a lot of impact in recent years. Corona algebras are a kind of quotient C\*-algebra that are closely related to quotient structures found in set theory like P($\omega$)/Fin. In this talk Iâ€™ll introduce these terms, and then present some work of (and together with) Ilijas Farah on outer automorphisms of corona algebras.

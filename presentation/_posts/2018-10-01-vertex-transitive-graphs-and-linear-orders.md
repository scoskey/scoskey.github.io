Boise Set Theory Seminar, Boise, October 2018<!--more-->

*Abstract*: John Clemens proved that the classification of countable vertex-transitive graphs is Borel complete. Extending the terminology from graphs, letâ€™s say that a structure A is vertex-transitive if Aut(A) acts transitively on A. In this talk we will discuss the classification of countable vertex-transitive directed graphs and linear orders. This is joint work with John Clemens and Stephanie Potter.

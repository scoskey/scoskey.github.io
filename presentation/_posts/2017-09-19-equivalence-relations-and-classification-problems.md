Boise Set Theory Seminar, September 2017<!--more-->

*Abstract*: Many classification problems in mathematics may be identified with an equivalence relation on a standard Borel space. In earlier talks we have been introduced to the notion of Borel reducibility of equivalence relations, as well as to some of the most important equivalence relations studied. In this talk we will introduce several natural classification problems and identify where they lie in the Borel reducibility order.

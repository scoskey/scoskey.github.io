Boise Set Theory Seminar, Boise, February 2015<!--more-->

*Abstract*: This talk is continued from last semester. We study the conjugacy relation on the automorphism group of a homogeneous structure from the point of view of Borel complexity theory. In particular, we present three examples of homogeneous graphs whose corresponding conjugacy problems have three different complexities.

*Further notes*: This talk is a continuation of [this one](/presentation/conjugacy-and-homogeneous-graphs/).

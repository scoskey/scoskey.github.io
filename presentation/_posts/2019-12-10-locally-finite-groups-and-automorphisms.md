Boise Set Theory and Logic Seminar, December 2019<!--more-->

Abstract: The class of finite groups is an amalgamation class, which means that they admit a “Fraisse limit” - a countable structure which contains all the finite groups and which is highly self-symmetric. The limit group is called Hall’s group, it is locally finite, and has the property that any isomorphic finite subgroups are conjugate. In this talk we will give background on Hall’s group and discuss constructing automorphisms of Hall’s group.

*Abstract*: This paper explores what has been termed, ``The Name Tag Problem'' (NTP). The problem is framed thusly. A group of $n$ people sit around a table and to each person a name tag has been assigned. How can you assign the nametags so that just one person has the correct name tag assigned, and no matter how many times the table is rotated, still just one person has the correct name tag assigned?

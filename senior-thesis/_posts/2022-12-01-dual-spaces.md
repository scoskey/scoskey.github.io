*Abstract*: Dual spaces are a fundamental piece of mathematics and are used for a variety of purposes. The ability to describe measurements in functions are an important aspect to be able to obtain and understand in all different fields of math. Functional analysis and many other disciplines are able to be further understood through the application of dual spaces. By seeing the connections between these different fields allows us to gain a better understanding of mathematics as a whole.

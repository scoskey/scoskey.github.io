*Abstract*: This article is about a calculus technique known as Integration by Parts and how we can fix some the issues that come up when students first learn it in Calculus 2 (Math 175). The current method of teaching Integration By Parts can be overly confusing and frustrating for students. The variables and the order in which we choose our variables does not make sense to a lot of them. u, dv, du, and v have no concrete meaning to them in terms of this specific technique because they see the formula but not what the individual parts of it are and how to use them. This paper will explain why we need to change how we teach Integration By Parts in the future.

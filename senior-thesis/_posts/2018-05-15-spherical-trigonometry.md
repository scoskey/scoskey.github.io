A senior thesis by Phung Le, Spring 2018<!--more-->

*Abstract*: We explore spherical geometry and trigonometry. This poster consists of four parts: (1) Using classical trigonometry to figure out how large is the Earth and the distance to the Moon; (2) How to find the distance between two places in the Earth; (3) Napier's Rule I and II and an application on the sea with a right-angle triangle; (4) Delambre's first analogy and an example of an oblique triangle.

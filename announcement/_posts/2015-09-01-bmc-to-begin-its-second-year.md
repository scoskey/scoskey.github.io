The Boise Math Circle is for local middle and high school students looking to connect with with the creative side of mathematics. We go outside many standard curriculums to explore fun and challenging topics. The goal is to give our participants little hints of modern math research and its applications.

If you are curious about interacting with more math, then apply to join us! You can find a lot more information as well as an application form on our web site: [boisemathcircles.org](http://boisemathcircles.org). Our first meeting is scheduled for September 19.

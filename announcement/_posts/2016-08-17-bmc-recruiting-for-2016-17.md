The Boise Math Circle is for local middle and high school students looking to connect with with the creative side of mathematics. Check out our web site at [boisemathcircles.org](http://boisemathcircles.org)!<!--more-->

Our first meeting is scheduled for Saturday, September 10. In math circle sessions, we introduce topics relevant to modern mathematics theory and practice. Much of what we do lies outside the standard curriculums, while sometimes we explore things you already know from a new point of view. It is always fun and stress-free. Full information including session dates and the application form can be found at our site above!

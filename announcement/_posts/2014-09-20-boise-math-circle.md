I'm really excited to write that our new math circle is up and running. We received a seed grant from the National Association of Math Circles a couple days ago, and had our first meeting this morning. It was a lot of fun!<!--more-->

A math circle is a math enrichment program for school students or school teachers. In our case we target middle and high school students who are seeking mathematical discoveries that their normal curriculum might not cover. (In fact most schools in Boise have fantastic math programs, so good that their students want more :)

Our circle consists of myself, my colleague [Joe Champion](http://math.boisestate.edu/jchampion), and several other interested students and faculty. I have been excited about math circles ever since I visited the ones in New York and Boston (thanks to Avital Oliver). Since Joe has run a math circle before, this has been a really easy opportunity for me to get involved.

You can check out our [web site](http://boisemathcircles.org), where we will post short descriptions of our discussions.
